# Traffic Simulation for CS322 (Software Engineering)

### Background
A team of traffic engineers wants to use simulation software to gain intuition about traffic congestion.
They are looking for simulation software that provides information on how traffic lights and stop signs 
impact congestion. The client’s main interest is to find the median time it takes for a car to get
through the city. The software will give the traffic engineers a good understanding of the
practical and essential use of traffic lights and stop signs.

### Description of Software
The purpose of the software is to simulate traffic flow in a city grid regulated by sensor­driven
traffic lights. The simulation feeds the city roads with cars randomly and determines the
median time it takes for cars to go through the grid. See the requirements document for more details.
