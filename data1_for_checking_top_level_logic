filename: data1_for_checking_top_level_logic 
When checking the top-level logic, the Java input statements should skip the 
first 17 lines in any file of data, then read a line as the value of 
numIntersectionsInOneDirection, then skip a line, then read a line as the 
number of cars to be created, then skip every other line (starting with skipping
the very next line) until the quantity of input numbers read is exactly
   6 times the number of cars to be created,
and then the Java program should no longer read any lines from the data file.
direction:  SOUTHWARD == 0; EASTWARD == 1; NORTHWARD == 2; WESTWARD == 3
The following three lines illustrate the somewhat-tricky terminology:
when a car travels south, the car travels SOUTHWARD
when an incoming segment of an intersection is aiming SOUTHWARD, the segment 
  is immediately north of that intersection
when an outgoing segment of an intersection is aiming SOUTHWARD, the segment
  is immediately south of that intersection
turning direction: NEVER_TURN == 0; TURN_RIGHTWARD == 1; TURN_LEFTWARD == -1
number of intersections in one direction:
2
