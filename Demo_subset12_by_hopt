Input the desired ID number of simulation (or -1, if you want the computer
to choose the ID number randomly):
Input the desired length of simulation (all times are in *simulated* time units): 
The number of intersections in north-south direction is the same as
the number in east-west direction.
Input the desired number of intersections in one direction: 
Input the desired time to begin creating marked cars whose statistical
properties will be summarized: 
Input the desired time to stop creating marked cars whose statistical
properties will be summarized: 
Input the desired maximum number of cars going in the same direction inside
one block of a street: 
Input the desired minimum time a light is green: 
Input the desired minimum time to change a red light to green: 
Input the desired minimum time for a car to travel one block: 
Input the desired minimum time for a car to travel from the end of one block
to the beginning of another block: 
Input one of the following integers to indicate your additional choices (these
are the *only* such choices possible with the current software):
  1  You want each car to only go straight
  2  You want each car never to turn left, and either to only go straight
     or to turn right exactly once
  3  You want each car to only go straight or to turn right exactly once
     or to turn left exactly once
What is your choice? (input 1, 2, or 3): 
Input the desired probability of a created car always moving straight.
(if you chose option 1, you must now input 1.0 exactly): 
Input the desired probability of arrival of a car per iteration:

During the simulation, there were 2 marked cars within the grid
and the median time a marked car was in the grid was 3.5
 
 
 
 
 
 NOW data2_for_TrafficView IS USED
 
<UNIX-PROMPT> java TrafficView < data2_for_TrafficView
Input the desired ID number of simulation (or -1, if you want the computer
to choose the ID number randomly):
Input the desired length of simulation (all times are in *simulated* time units): 
The number of intersections in north-south direction is the same as
the number in east-west direction.
Input the desired number of intersections in one direction: 
Input the desired time to begin creating marked cars whose statistical
properties will be summarized: 
Input the desired time to stop creating marked cars whose statistical
properties will be summarized: 
Input the desired maximum number of cars going in the same direction inside
one block of a street: 
Input the desired minimum time a light is green: 
Input the desired minimum time to change a red light to green: 
Input the desired minimum time for a car to travel one block: 
Input the desired minimum time for a car to travel from the end of one block
to the beginning of another block: 
Input one of the following integers to indicate your additional choices (these
are the *only* such choices possible with the current software):
  1  You want each car to only go straight
  2  You want each car never to turn left, and either to only go straight
     or to turn right exactly once
  3  You want each car to only go straight or to turn right exactly once
     or to turn left exactly once
What is your choice? (input 1, 2, or 3): 
When properly programmed, the simulation should make equally likely a car
going straight or turning right exactly once.
Input the desired probability of a created car always moving straight.
(if you chose option 1, you must now input 1.0 exactly): 
Input the desired probability of arrival of a car per iteration:

Input the desired length of simulation (all times are in *simulated* time units): 
The number of intersections in north-south direction is the same as
the number in east-west direction.
Input the desired number of intersections in one direction: 
Input the desired time to begin creating marked cars whose statistical
properties will be summarized: 
Input the desired time to stop creating marked cars whose statistical
properties will be summarized: 
Input the desired maximum number of cars going in the same direction inside
one block of a street: 
Input the desired minimum time a light is green: 
Input the desired minimum time to change a red light to green: 
Input the desired minimum time for a car to travel one block: 
Input the desired minimum time for a car to travel from the end of one block
to the beginning of another block: 
Input one of the following integers to indicate your additional choices (these
are the *only* such choices possible with the current software):
  1  You want each car to only go straight
  2  You want each car never to turn left, and either to only go straight
     or to turn right exactly once
  3  You want each car to only go straight or to turn right exactly once
     or to turn left exactly once
What is your choice? (input 1, 2, or 3): 
When properly programmed, the simulation should make equally likely a car
going straight or turning right exactly once or turning left exactly once.
Input the desired probability of a created car always moving straight.
(if you chose option 1, you must now input 1.0 exactly): 
Input the desired probability of arrival of a car per iteration:

 NOW data4_for_TrafficView IS USED, WHILE DebugOutput IS DEACTIVATED
 
<UNIX-PROMPT> java TrafficView < data4_for_TrafficView
Input the desired ID number of simulation (or -1, if you want the computer
to choose the ID number randomly):
Input the desired length of simulation (all times are in *simulated* time units): 
The number of intersections in north-south direction is the same as
the number in east-west direction.
Input the desired number of intersections in one direction: 
Input the desired time to begin creating marked cars whose statistical
properties will be summarized: 
Input the desired time to stop creating marked cars whose statistical
properties will be summarized: 
Input the desired maximum number of cars going in the same direction inside
one block of a street: 
Input the desired minimum time a light is green: 
Input the desired minimum time to change a red light to green: 
Input the desired minimum time for a car to travel one block: 
Input the desired minimum time for a car to travel from the end of one block
to the beginning of another block: 
Input one of the following integers to indicate your additional choices (these
are the *only* such choices possible with the current software):
  1  You want each car to only go straight
  2  You want each car never to turn left, and either to only go straight
     or to turn right exactly once
  3  You want each car to only go straight or to turn right exactly once
     or to turn left exactly once
What is your choice? (input 1, 2, or 3): 
When properly programmed, the simulation should make equally likely a car
going straight or turning right exactly once or turning left exactly once.
Input the desired probability of a created car always moving straight.
(if you chose option 1, you must now input 1.0 exactly): 
Input the desired probability of arrival of a car per iteration:
